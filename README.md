## README ##
Syslinux is a Ruby gem that will enable the user to efficiently access much system information from their Linux computer. It includes (or will include) CPU, RAM, OS, environment, process, and motherboard information.


This gem is designed to be used as part of either a server-type program for constant monitoring, or for use in other programs that might need access to system data.


## NOTES ##
1) I don't use Windows. Don't ask me to port this to Windows. **I am not touching that mess with a 10-foot pole.**
1) If you use Mac or some other non-Linux, Unix system, feel free to port this -- it should be relatively easy. Later on, I will adjust it to read in a JSON config file, so you can probably just change the directories and file names.
